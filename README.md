## Learning Approach

Each project follows a structured methodology:
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Define security objectives and success criteria
2. **Architecture Design** - Plan secure, scalable solutions
3. **Implementation** - Deploy with security best practices
4. **Testing & Validation** - Verify security controls and functionality
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and lessons learned

## Key Achievements

- Deployed hardened cloud infrastructure following CIS benchmarks
- Implemented automated threat detection with custom correlation rules
- Created comprehensive security documentation and procedures
- Demonstrated end-to-end security operations capabilities

## Contact & Collaboration
